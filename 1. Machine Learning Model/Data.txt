Space Apps 2024 Seismic Detection Data Packet: Data and catalogs for this dataset are typically stored in archive format which is difficult to assess during the duration of a hackathon. Due to this, the team compiled all of the required data into an analysis-ready format, hosted by the Planetary Data System Geosciences Node at Washington University in St. Louis. It contains:

A Python Jupyter Notebook with useful codes to help you get started with the data
A “lunar” subfolder containing:
Training data (in miniseed and CSV format) for Grade A lunar events from Apollo 12, a seismic catalog, and plots.
A test dataset (in miniseed and CSV format) using Grade A and B data from Apollo 12, 15, and 16
A “mars” subfolder containing:
Training data (in miniseed and CSV format) for two events recorded for InSight, a seismic catalog, and plots.
A test dataset (in miniseed and CSV format) for Mars InSight events occurring from 2019-2022.
